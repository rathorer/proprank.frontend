  "India must provide dignified, affordable, formal housing to millions

  urban population continues to live in slums and unauthorised colonies."

**Did you know?**

Nearly half of India’s urban population (\~49%) still lives in slums, unauthorised colonies, squatter settlements, and shanties.

That’s why:

•	Million-dollar homes in Mumbai often overlook slums.

•	Delhi’s skyline reveals a sea of unauthorised colonies.

•	Other Indian cities aren’t far behind too.

**Why do informal settlements keep growing?**

Because while rural-to-urban migration surges, affordable, quality housing is missing.

Formal supply mainly caters to middle- & high-income buyers → pushing migrants into slums & colonies, often carved out by local land mafias.

**Is there any Progress? Yes, but it’s mixed across cities.**

•	Slum population share fell from 55% (2002) → 49% (2020) (World Bank).

•	Cities like Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Chennai saw slum % decline.

•	But Delhi, Bengaluru, Pune, Hyderabad actually saw it rise.

**What does this cost India? A lot.**

•	Poor access to water, sanitation, schools, healthcare.

•	No secure land titles or regulated layouts.

•	Overcrowding, safety risks & weak infrastructure.

**But how can this crisis be fixed?**

•	Mass supply of affordable housing linked with jobs & transport.

•	Affordable rental housing near industrial hubs.

•	Livability-focused redevelopment of existing slums.

•	Stricter checks to stop unauthorised colonies before they grow.
