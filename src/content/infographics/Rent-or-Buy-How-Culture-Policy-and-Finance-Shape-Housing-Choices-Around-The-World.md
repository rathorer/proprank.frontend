  "So basically around the world, home ownership isn’t the goal; security
  is—whether via a home you own or a rental policy that protects you."

\*\*Do you really need to own a home? \*\*

The answer depends on where you live.

Around the world, cultures and policies shape whether people buy or rent:

**Nations of Owners**

•	Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, Croatia, Kazakhstan → ownership dominates, driven by socialist-era housing privatized and sold cheaply.

•	Singapore → despite sky-high prices, public housing plus pension financing ensures almost everyone owns.

•	India → culturally, “a home = security.” But there’s a big split → rural India sees near-universal ownership, while in cities affordability gaps push many into rentals.

•	China & Vietnam → ownership is deeply cultural, tied to land access and social status.

**In-Between (Owners & Renters)**

•	UK, US, France, Japan → owning is common, but renting is equally accepted. Families spread wealth between homes, pensions, and financial markets.

**Renting Strongholds**

•	Germany, Austria, Switzerland → renting isn’t a stigma. Leases are secure, tenant rights strong, and people build wealth via pensions and markets instead of only property.

**Where Ownership Stays Low**

•	Nigeria → rapid urbanisation but little mortgage access.

•	UAE → an expat-driven population where renting is the default.

•	Hong Kong → the world’s priciest housing market, with luxury towers standing empty while ordinary residents struggle for affordable homes.

**So what can India learn?**

1\.	Blend models → Affordable first homes (like Singapore) + secure rentals (like Germany).

2\.	Curb speculation → Vacancy taxes to stop hoarding.

3\.	Build what’s needed → Avoid Hong Kong’s luxury trap.

4\.	Boost financial literacy → So wealth isn’t locked only in property.
